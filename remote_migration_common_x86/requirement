I.Requirement
(1)The content log could be saved to a log file
(2)A basic ping-pong migration case could be executed
(3)The information of destination host(like ip and hostname) is just needed be specified in command at the beginning of
    executing case, and the source host information is not needed to be input.
(4)It is possible to execute multiple cases at once, each case is independent with others.
(5)If one of case error, the next case could be executed normally and automatically.

(10)RHEL7-10052 - [migration] Measure the  migration speed(max-bandwidth)
(11)RHEL7-10059 - [migration] Ping-pong migration during file transfer ===> done
